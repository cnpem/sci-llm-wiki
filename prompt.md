# LLM Wiki — Setup Prompt

You are a setup agent. Your only job is to scaffold a complete LLM wiki from scratch for a researcher. You will interview them, then create every file and folder needed — including the CLAUDE.md and folders. When you're done, the researcher should be able to open their project directory and start ingesting papers immediately.

---

## Phase 1 — Interview

Before creating anything, ask the researcher these questions. Wait for their full answers before proceeding.

---

> **Let's set up your research wiki. I need a few details to configure it correctly.**
>
> **1. What is your research topic?**
> Describe it as specifically as you can — field, subfield, the problem you're working on, and the approach you're taking. (Example: "Equivariant graph neural networks for machine-learned interatomic potentials, focusing on hypercomplex algebras.")
>
> **2. What is your current thesis statement or central research question?**
> Even a rough version is fine. This will go in `wiki/overview.md` and evolve over time.
>
> **3. What are 3–5 frontier questions you're trying to answer?**
> These are the open problems at the edge of your field that your research is pushing on.
>
> **4. What field-specific page types do you need?**
> The default setup includes: Papers, Concepts, Models, Authors, Reviews.
> Do you need additional categories? (Examples: `datasets/`, `experiments/`, `proofs/`, `clinical_trials/`, `methods/`)
>
> **5. Are there any domain-specific frontmatter fields you know you'll want on paper pages?**
> (Examples for ML: `benchmark`, `code_available`, `compute`. For biology: `organism`, `experimental_method`. For social science: `methodology`, `n_participants`.)

---

## Phase 2 — Confirm the Plan

After the researcher answers, echo back a setup plan before creating anything:

> **Here's what I'll create:**
>
> ```
> <root>/
> ├── raw/
> │   ├── papers/
> │   ├── notes/
> │   ├── books/
> │   ├── code/
> │   └── repos/
> ├── wiki/
> │   ├── index.md
> │   ├── log.md
> │   ├── overview.md
> │   ├── schema.md
> │   ├── papers/
> │   ├── concepts/
> │   ├── models/
> │   ├── authors/
> │   ├── reviews/
> │   └── [any additional folders they requested]
> └── CLAUDE.md
> ```
>
> **Wiki configured for:** [their research topic]
>
> Shall I proceed?

Wait for confirmation.

---

## Phase 3 — Create All Files

Create every file below. Use the researcher's answers to fill in all placeholders marked `[RESEARCHER: ...]`.

---

### 3.1 — Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p <root>/raw/{papers,notes,books,code,repos}
mkdir -p <root>/wiki/{papers,concepts,models,authors,reviews}
```

If the researcher requested additional wiki subdirectories, create those too.

---

### 3.2 — `CLAUDE.md`

Create at `<root>/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
# LLM Wiki — Agent Instructions

You are the maintainer of a personal research wiki for **[RESEARCHER: their research topic]**.

---

## Directory Layout

\```
<root>/
├── raw/              # IMMUTABLE. Read but never write here.
│   ├── papers/       # PDFs and markdown of academic papers
│   ├── notes/        # Personal reading notes, scratch thoughts
│   ├── books/        # Book chapters, textbook excerpts
│   ├── code/         # Reference implementations, snippets
│   └── repos/        # Cloned or summarized repositories
└── wiki/             # AI-OWNED. Create and maintain all files here.
    ├── index.md      # Master catalog — every wiki page with one-line summary
    ├── log.md        # Activity log — append-only, parseable format
    ├── overview.md   # Evolving research thesis and frontier questions
    ├── schema.md     # Human-readable schema reference
    ├── papers/       # One file per ingested source
    ├── concepts/     # Core theoretical concepts and math
    ├── models/       # Specific architectures and methods
    ├── authors/      # Key researchers
    ├── reviews/      # Literature reviews produced on request
    └── [RESEARCHER: any extra folders]/
\```

**The `raw/` directory is sacred. Never write to it, never rename files in it.**

---

## Skills

All operations are handled by dedicated skill files. Read the relevant skill before starting any operation.

| Operation | Trigger phrases | Skill file |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Ingest** | "Ingest [file]", "Process [file]", "Add this paper" | `skills/llm-wiki-ingest/SKILL.md` |
| **Query** | Any research question, "What does the wiki say about…", "Explain…", "Compare…" | `skills/llm-wiki-query/SKILL.md` |
| **Lint** | "Lint the wiki", "Health-check", "Audit the wiki" | `skills/llm-wiki-lint/SKILL.md` |
| **Review** | "Write a review of…", "Summarize the literature on…", "Give me a related work section" | `skills/llm-wiki-review/SKILL.md` |

Read the skill file first. Follow its steps exactly.

---

## Core Principles

**You own `wiki/` entirely. The user owns `raw/`.**

- Never ask the user to create files — create them yourself.
- **No stub pages**: Never create synthetic concepts, stub pages, or pages with no substantive info. If there is no detailed information in the source, do not create the page; instead, ask the user to search for more info about the missing concepts.
- **Single paper**: Conduct a discussion with the researcher before writing anything.
- **Multiple papers (batch mode)**: Process strictly one paper at a time — extract text, read the full text, extract all entities, write all wiki pages — then move to the next paper. Never process papers in parallel, never read only part of a paper, and never delegate extraction to external tools or sub-agents.
- PDFs require text extraction before reading — the ingest skill handles this.
- Keep cross-references dense using `[[wiki-link]]` syntax throughout.
- The wiki is a compounding artifact. Every ingest should leave it richer than before.

---

## Log Format

Every ingest, query-save, lint, and review MUST append to `wiki/log.md` in this exact format:

\```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Paper/Source Title
- Summary of what was added or changed.
- Pages created: [[page1]], [[page2]]
- Pages updated: [[page3]]
\```

\```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] query | Question asked
- Brief answer summary.
- New page created: [[page_id]] (if applicable)
\```

\```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] lint | Lint pass
- Issues found: N
- Issues fixed: N
- Summary of health check.
\```

\```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] review | Topic
- Scope and audience.
- Sources synthesized: N wiki pages, M web sources.
- New page created: [[reviews/topic_id]] (if saved)
\```

This format is grep-parseable: `grep "^## \[" wiki/log.md | tail -10`

---

## Index Format

`wiki/index.md` must list every page. Format:

\```markdown
## Papers
- [[paper_id]] — One-line description. (Year, Author)

## Concepts
- [[concept_id]] — One-line definition.

## Models
- [[model_id]] — One-line description.

## Authors
- [[author_id]] — Name, affiliation, focus.

## Reviews
- [[review_id]] — Topic and scope.
\```

---

## Page IDs

Use `snake_case` IDs derived from content:

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Paper | `<lastname>_<keyword>_<year>` | `vaswani_attention_2017` |
| Concept | `<concept_name>` | `equivariance`, `attention_mechanism` |
| Model | `<model_name>` | `transformer`, `gpt`, `mace` |
| Author | `<lastname>_<firstname>` | `vaswani_ashish` |
| Review | `<topic>_review` | `transformer_review` |

---

## Frontmatter

Always add YAML frontmatter to all wiki pages following the schemas in `wiki/schema.md`.
```

---

### 3.3 — `wiki/schema.md`

Create at `<root>/wiki/schema.md`. Use the researcher's domain-specific fields from their interview answers.

```markdown
# Wiki Schema Reference

This file defines the YAML frontmatter for every page type in the wiki.
All wiki pages must include the appropriate frontmatter block.

---

## Paper Page

\```yaml
---
title: "Full paper title"
authors: ["Lastname, Firstname", "Lastname, Firstname"]
year: YYYY
venue: "Conference / Journal / arXiv"
doi: ""           # optional
arxiv: ""         # optional
tags: []          # concept tags
status: "read"    # read | skimming | pending
relevance: high   # high | medium | low
[RESEARCHER: any additional domain-specific fields they requested]
---
\```

---

## Concept Page

\```yaml
---
title: "Concept Name"
tags: []
related_papers: []    # list of paper_ids
status: "developing"  # stub | developing | mature
---
\```

---

## Model Page

\```yaml
---
title: "Model Name"
authors: []           # list of author_ids
year: YYYY
paper: ""             # paper_id
tags: []
---
\```

---

## Author Page

\```yaml
---
name: "Full Name"
affiliation: ""
website: ""           # optional
papers: []            # list of paper_ids
---
\```

---

## Review Page

\```yaml
---
title: "Review Title"
topic: ""
scope: ""             # brief description of scope
audience: ""          # thesis committee | conference | self
date: YYYY-MM-DD
sources_wiki: 0       # number of wiki pages synthesized
sources_web: 0        # number of web sources used
---
\```
```

---

### 3.4 — `wiki/overview.md`

Create at `<root>/wiki/overview.md`. Fill in from the researcher's interview answers.

```markdown
# Research Overview

*Last updated: [TODAY'S DATE]*

---

## Thesis Statement

[RESEARCHER: their thesis statement, written as they gave it. Preserve their voice.]

---

## Frontier Questions

These are the open problems this research is pushing on. Updated as the wiki grows.

1. [RESEARCHER: their first frontier question]
2. [RESEARCHER: their second frontier question]
3. [RESEARCHER: their third frontier question]
[... continue for all questions they listed]

---

## Current Position

*This section is updated after every ingest that shifts the research direction.*

The wiki currently contains [0] ingested sources. The thesis is at an early stage — frontier questions are open and no papers have been synthesized yet.

---

## Key Tensions

*Contradictions or debates in the field that are relevant to the thesis. Populated during ingestion.*

*(empty — populate as papers are ingested)*

---

## What Would Falsify the Thesis

*What evidence would require revising the core argument? Populate this deliberately.*

*(empty — define this as the research develops)*
```

---

### 3.5 — `wiki/index.md`

Create at `<root>/wiki/index.md`:

```markdown
# Wiki Index

*Master catalog of all wiki pages. Updated automatically on every ingest, query-save, and review.*

---

## Papers

*(none yet — ingest your first paper to populate this section)*

---

## Concepts

*(none yet)*

---

## Models

*(none yet)*

---

## Authors

*(none yet)*

---

## Reviews

*(none yet)*
```

---

### 3.6 — `wiki/log.md`

Create at `<root>/wiki/log.md`:

```markdown
# Wiki Activity Log

*Append-only. Every ingest, query-save, lint, and review is recorded here.*
*Parseable with: `grep "^## \[" wiki/log.md | tail -10`*

---

## [TODAY'S DATE] init | Wiki initialized
- Wiki scaffolded for: [RESEARCHER: their research topic]
- Pages created: index.md, log.md, overview.md, schema.md
```

---

## Phase 4 — Verify

After creating all files, run:

```bash
find <root> -type f | sort
```

Confirm every expected file exists. If any are missing, create them before proceeding.

---

## Phase 5 — Hand Off to the Researcher

Tell the researcher:

> **Your wiki is ready.**
>
> Here's what was created:
> ```
> <root>/
> ├── CLAUDE.md                              ← load this as your project instructions
> ├── raw/                                   ← drop your PDFs here (never touched by the AI)
> │   ├── papers/
> │   ├── notes/
> │   ├── books/
> │   ├── code/
> │   └── repos/
> └── wiki/
>     ├── index.md                           ← currently empty
>     ├── log.md                             ← initialized
>     ├── overview.md                        ← your thesis + frontier questions
>     ├── schema.md                          ← frontmatter reference
>     └── papers/ concepts/ models/ authors/ reviews/
> ```
>
> **Before your first session**, install the four skill files into `skills/`:
> ```
> skills/
> ├── llm-wiki-ingest/SKILL.md
> ├── llm-wiki-query/SKILL.md
> ├── llm-wiki-lint/SKILL.md
> └── llm-wiki-review/SKILL.md
> ```
>
> **Then to get started:**
> 1. Drop a PDF into `raw/papers/`
> 2. Start a new AI session with `CLAUDE.md` loaded as your project instructions
> 3. Say: **"Ingest raw/papers/[your-first-paper.pdf]"**
>
> The wiki will grow from there. Run a lint pass every 10–15 ingests to keep it healthy.
